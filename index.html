    Hello! I'm Darien, a Computer Science student at Cal State East Bay with a 4.0 GPA, graduating in May 2027. 
    I work on campus as a Learning Assistant where I help supplement student learning, coach their study habits, and run small support sessions before major assessments.
    Prior, I tutored 4th-6th grade math one-on-one, which influenced my eventual mastery of patience and communication.
    I learn best by shipping and by actively working with others or by myself. I built a React + Nginx address book app with account registration, login, cookies, and full client-side flow.
    At MESA U Hacks, my team earned 2nd Best Pitch for NimbusNotes, where I handled the backend and API. Early in my career, I helped prototype a simple cipher helper using the Perplexity API at Hack Hayward.
    Currently: I work in Python, C++, React, Linux, and Git, and am actively learning ML and SQL.
    Being sincere, the joy of creation and creativity that programming brings is ultimately what shapes me, both as a person and my journey to exceed the person I was yesterday.
